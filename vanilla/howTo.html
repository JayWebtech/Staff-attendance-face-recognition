    <h1>How To Use</h1>
    <p>Below are instructions on how to use the system and handle any problem you might occur when
      using it </p>

    <section class="sect">
      <h3>Registration</h3>
      <p>The registration stage captures are student's face and saves it to an online database in
        order to perform face recognition later on in the attendance stage</p>
      <ul>
        <li>click the register button on the homepage</li>
        <li>Wait for few seconds as the face recognition initializes</li>
        <li>The Face recognition system would capture your face the moment it detects it</li>
        <li>After capturing, a new page for you to enter your name is loaded</li>
        <li>Input your name and save <i>Note, this is the name that the system would use for all
            further attendance purpose</i></li>
        <li>you are then navigated back to the home page </li>
        <li>registration Completed</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i> You can't capture your face manually or upload an image to avoid computer vision
          errors</i></p>
    </section>

    <section class="sect">
      <h3>Attendance</h3>
      <p>The Attendance stage compares a given face with the images in the database and when a match
        is found, it triggers a function that adds the current data and time the the student's
        file(database)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>click the Attendance button on the homepage</li>
        <li>Wait for few seconds as the face recognition initializes</li>
        <li>The Face recognition system would capture your face the moment it detects it</li>
        <li>After capturing, a comparison is done on the back end and a result is returned</li>
        <li>After few seconds the page is reloaded</li>
        <li>Attendance Completed</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Alternative</h3>
      <p>Few seconds can range from 1second to about 15seconds depending on the internet speed, the
        CPU or GPU capacity and other variables, based on this the Face attendance might not always
        be optimal</p>
      <p>In case of large scale events, an alternate option was included, that takes attendance by
        just a click of a button.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>click the Alt Attendance button on the homepage</li>
        <li>Wait for few seconds the database loads all students</li>
        <li>After that with just a click on the name the attendance database is updated</li>
        <li>Attendance Completed</li>
      </ul>
      <i>This Alternative also comes with full offline support</i>
